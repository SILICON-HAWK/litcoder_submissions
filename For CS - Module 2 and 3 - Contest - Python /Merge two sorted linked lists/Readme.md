Suppose we have two sorted linked lists, represented by the pointers headA and headB. Our task is to merge these two lists into a single sorted linked list. It's possible for either headX or headY to be null, indicating that the corresponding list is empty.

For example, consider the following linked lists:

headX refers to 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> NULL
headY refers to 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> NULL

We need to merge these two lists into a new list, where the elements are sorted in ascending order. After merging, the resulting linked list would be:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 8 -> NULL
